**Lex Talionis** is a game engine and editor for creating your own custom Fire Emblem fangame. If you've wanted to make your own Fire Emblem fangame but were fed up with the hackery that's required to master ROM-hacking, or you just want to work with total control over the code itself, **Lex Talionis** is for you.

**Lex Talionis** was originally released without a dedicated graphical editor, which meant all game creation was done through modification of text files and xml files. But no longer!

**LT-maker** is the easy-to-use but powerful editor built on top of the **Lex Talionis** engine. The **Lex Talionis** engine itself as been completely rewritten using the knowledge gained over seven years of development to be faster, better, and easier-to-use. You can create a whole new game without touching any code.

## Getting Started

![EditorScreenshot](utilities/readme/editor_screenshot.png)

**LT-maker** includes two sample projects. The default project contains the first six chapters of *the Sacred Stones*. You should modify this project to build your own game. **LT-maker** also includes *the Lion Throne*, which is an original fangame created during development of the legacy **Lex Talionis engine**. It has been recreated in **LT-maker** and should be used freely as reference.
