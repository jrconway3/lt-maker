# Special Variables

_Last updated v0.1_

This appendix details every special game or level variable used by the **Lex Talionis** engine. Normally, game and level variables are utilized by the game designer in events, but a special set of names are reserved by the engine for specific uses.

## Format:

`command` **type** description

## Game Variables

These variables are saved for the entirety of a given game.

`_next_level_nid` **Level (str)** Internal to the engine; Do not modify yourself.

`_goto_level` **Level (str)** Set to the nid of the level you want to go to next. If not set, the engine will just move to the following level like normal. Reset upon the start of the next level. If set to `_force_quit`, game will end (and return to title screen) instead of moving to the following level.

`_go_to_overworld_nid` **Overworld (str)** Set to the nid of the overworld to go to next.

`_current_turnwheel_uses` **int** The number of uses of the turnwheel left in this level. Defaults to -1, which represents infinite uses. Automatically reset to `_max_turnwheel_uses` upon winning the a level.

Set to 2 to have fatigue apply a Fatigued status when fatigue >= max fatigue and Rested when fatigue < max fatigue. Set to 3 to have the engine track fatigue but not do anything with it by default.

`_prep_market` **bool** Set to True to give the player access to the market in the prep screen.
