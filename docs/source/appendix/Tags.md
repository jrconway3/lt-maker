# Tags

_last updated v0.1_

This appendix details every tag that the **Lex Talionis** engine handles uniquely. You can of course assign other tags to units and classes and check for them in your own event scripts or item/skill components.

Both units and classes can be assigned tags. A unit in game has it's own tags as well as the tags of it's class. 

## Special Tags
